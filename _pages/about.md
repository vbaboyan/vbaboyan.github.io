I'm a graduate student currently pursuing a research doctorate in Cognitive Neuroscience from the Auditory & Language Neuroscience Lab at UC Irvine (UCI). As part of my dissertation work - generously funded by the National Science Foundation - I like to analyze multimodal brain imaging data to make sense of the wiring patterns enabling human language. As a grad student studying language, i've developed a passion for applying data science techniques to generate insights about this process to let the data speak for itself. I like to accomplish this using a variety of scripting languages (R, Matlab, UNIX) and high-performance computing (SGE, Slurm) made possible through the excellent HPC resources provided by UCI. I'd say this page is primarily dedicated to not only showcasing my research findings, but also to document some of my personal interests in nutrition using the tools i've acquired as a scientist. I truly believe that each of us are endowed with a responsibility to take care of our bodies and, with the unprecedented access to information brought forth by the internet, i'm excited to share ideas (and code) with others in the process.

Professionally, I anticipate making the transition from academia into industry in order to work in translational environments where efforts to treat neurological function are the primary force guiding company operations.

Thanks for visiting my page. I'd happily get in contact with you through the links provided.
