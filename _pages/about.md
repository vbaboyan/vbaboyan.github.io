Graduate student currently pursuing a research doctorate in Cognitive Neuroscience from the Auditory & Language Neuroscience Lab at UC Irvine (UCI). As part of my dissertation work, I analyze multimodal brain imaging data to make sense of the wiring patterns enabling human language. My passions are in applying data science techniques to generate insights in a data-driven manner to either validate or reveal insights about the brain. I like to accomplish this using a variety of scripting languages in a high-performance computing environment (HPC) made possible through the excellent HPC resources provided by UCI. I'd say this page is primarily dedicated to not only showcasing my research findings, but also to document some of my personal interests in nutrition using the tools i've acquired as a scientist. I truly believe that each of us are endowed with the responsibility of taking care of our bodies. With the unprecedented access to information brought forth by the internet, i'm excited to dive into this area and document my experiences here. 

Professionally, I anticipate making the transition from academia into industry in order to work in translational environments where efforts to treat neurological function are the primary force guiding company operations.

Thanks for visiting my page.
