I'm a graduate student currently pursuing a research doctorate in Cognitive Neuroscience from the Auditory & Language Neuroscience Lab at UC Irvine (UCI). As part of my dissertation work - generously funded by the National Science Foundation - I like to analyze MRI data to make sense of the wiring patterns enabling human language. As a grad student studying language, i've developed a passion for applying data science techniques to generate insights about this process to let the data "speak for itself". I like to accomplish this using a variety of scripting languages (R, Matlab, UNIX) and high-performance computing (SGE, Slurm) made possible through the excellent HPC resources provided by UCI. My preferred programming language is R (over Python) primarily because of how helpful I find the *caret* package to be when building predictive models. I'd say this page is generally dedicated to not only showcasing my research findings, but also to document some of my personal interests in nutrition using the tools i've acquired as a scientist. I truly believe that each of us are endowed with a responsibility to take care of our bodies and, with the unprecedented access to information brought forth by the internet, i'm excited to share ideas (and code) with others in the process.

Professionally, I anticipate making the transition from academia into industry in order to work in translational environments where efforts to treat neurological illness are the primary force guiding company operations.

In my spare time, i'm most likely watching the NBA (Purple and Gold all day!), boxing, traveling, or scouring the internet for electronic music records to add to my vinyl collection.
