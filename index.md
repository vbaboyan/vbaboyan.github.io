I'm a graduate student currently pursuing a research doctorate in Cognitive Neuroscience at UC Irvine. As part of my dissertation work - generously funded by the National Science Foundation - I analyze brain scans to study the neurobiology of language with an emphasis on the wiring patterns (i.e., *the connectomics*) enabling this uniquely human capacity.

I'm passionate about applying data science techniques on MRI data to generate insights that let the data "speak for itself". My work is made possible using a variety of scripting languages (R, Matlab, UNIX), imaging software (FreeSurfer/FSL/AFNI), and high-performance computing (SGE, Slurm) offered through the excellent HPC resources provided by UCI. I'd say this page is generally dedicated to not only showcasing my research findings, but also to document and discuss some of my personal interests in nutrition and wellness. I truly believe that each of us are endowed with a responsibility to take care of our physical and mental health, and with the unprecedented access to information brought forth by the internet, i'm excited to share ideas with others in the process.

Professionally, I anticipate making the transition from academia into industry in order to work in translational environments where efforts to treat neurological illness are the primary force guiding company operations.

In my spare time, you can spot me watching NBA games, at the gym boxing or weightlifting, traveling, resisting black licorice temptations, or scouring the internet for electronic music records to add to my vinyl collection. The genres I enjoy most are electronic world music and minimal/dub-techno. My favorite producers are [Nicolas Jaar (CL/US)](https://youtu.be/BMPT8nzg9ho), [David August (DE)](https://youtu.be/cwL_CIhS9Qs), and [Viken Arman (AM/FR)](https://youtu.be/j_npZfZmRiM).
