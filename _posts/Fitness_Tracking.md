excerpt: "A year's worth of results."

About a year ago, I decided to make some changes to my lifestyle. I had noticed that grad school had really disrupted my sleep/wake cycles and my nutrition. By my 4th year of grad school, I was weighing just under 220 lbs - the heaviest I had ever been. Something needed to give. With the recent rise of quality wearable devices and smart products, I thought it'd be the perfect time to embark on a data-driven journey into sleep and fitness tracking.

## What gets measured, get's managed.

Back then, I ended up going with the FitBit Charge 3 device considering it had the features I was interested in while also having a minimalistic user interface. I really didn't want another glowing screen from hell going off constantly on my wrist and wreaking havoc on my attention span. A month after I picked up the FitBit, I started getting a little weary of the weight tracking feature in the app. I couldn't believe I had to manually enter my weight every day - there had to be a better way. That's when I came across a smart scale on amazon that was being advertised as working with the FitBit, such that everytime you stepped on the scale it would would push all kinds of stats (e.g., Weight, body fat %, BMI) automatically to the FitBit app. Bingo! Check out my results from January 1st, 2019 :)

Now this is what i'm talking about! The ideal plot in this situation would be a decreasing curve that tapers off after reaching stability. I'd say this is pretty close. So a year later, I weight right about 190lbs and look/feel as good as i've ever been thanks to these fantastic technologies guiding the way. If you haven't already, i'd highly consider adding complementary technologies like this into your life. Here's what the smart scale looks like when I step on it:

The beauty of the app is that it not only provides you with trends for each of the measurements (as shown in the FitBit App above), but it also tells you where you numbers compare with healthy age-matched benchmarks. I think this is great - since having a set of standards for comparison is a great way to stay motivated and competitive. All is green, all is well.

## Lifestyle changes that work.
Obviously, just buying these products isn't going to make you lose weight. So what were some of the lifestyle strategies I used in the process? The first, and in my opinion the most necessary, was intermittent fasting. I no longer eat 3 meals a day and restrict my eating window between 12pm- 6pm. There is well-documented evidence that breakfast actually isn't the most important meal of the day and really was just a marketing ploy by cereal companies. 2 wholesome meals is all you really need for your body to function optimally and allows you to stay under the 2000 calorie per day recommendations. The second change was ditching the carbs. I honestly question the nutritional value of carbohydrates entirely and have no hesitation in expressing this. I switched the carbs out with more greens, vegetables, and healthy fats and the result has been tremendous. I think a proper nutritional plan is 85% of the battle when it comes to weight loss. The remaining 15% relates to your actual activity. So the third change was - and it's no secret - working my tail off at the gym. Importantly though, I think every person should have a cardio exercise that they enjoy.
An even better approach for your brain health is to pick up an entirely new hobby for this that requires technique. In my case, I'm obsessed with boxing. My favorite part of my workout is heading to the heavy bag right afterward and working on my game while sweating like crazy. I easily burn 200-300 calories from just 15 minutes of pure fun. If i've learned anything from being a neuroscientist, it's that brain **needs** to learn new things. Novelty is the most important snack you can give your neurons and perfecting a new craft is the ultimate brain buffet. Blurring the line between exercise and play is a great approach. Whether it's through boxing, racketball, basketball, try to step away from activities that are just mindless over-exertion (e.g., the elliptical).


## Summary & Insights
1. Wearable devices and Smart Scales are the perfect combination to take your goals to the next level.
2. Restricting your eating window and eating twice a day is a sustainable approach to weight loss.
3. Nutrition is 85% of the battle. Question your carbohydrates.
3. Find an aerobic activity that you can learn that requires technique.
